# inventory

This is a Typescript project to illustrate TDD classicist outside-in.

## Challenge

To write a little application to manage a simple inventory system:

* Add products
* Remove products
* Get inventory of a given product
* Get History of the inventory changes of a product
* Get History of all the products

To simplify we use the name of the product as identifier, but you can work

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 18 or higher recommended)
- npm (version 8 or higher recommended)

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Available Commands

- `npm run build`: Compile TypeScript files to JavaScript
- `npm run test`: Run tests with Vitest
- `npm run lint`: Run Biome linter
- `npm run format`: Format code with Biome

## Development

The project uses:
- TypeScript for type-safe JavaScript
- Vitest for testing
- Biome for linting and formatting

Source code goes in `src/` directory and tests in `test/` directory.
